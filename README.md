#This is the Prep Network frontend challenge

In this project I used the static site generator Gatsby. 
This challenge was to make a dynamically generated navbar that pulls in data from a json file.

To get this app up and running on a local machine download the project file and in the terminal type *npm install*
and then enter *npm start* to start the development enviroment on port 8000.

A deployed version of this app can be found at https://prep-network-frontend-challenge.netlify.com/

Here is a link the github repository https://github.com/Fitzpa/front_end_challenge
